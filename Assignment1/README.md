## Course Topics

TBD




## Miscellaneous

- All students need a [Github](http://github.com) account
- All programs need to be turned in to pass the course
- General Assignment Rules:
    - Due dates and times will be listed with prior notice to class.
    - Formatting of programs is important, and will be graded accordingly. 
    - You name is required on ALL documents uploaded or turned in. Handwritten name is not acceptable.
    - All files / programs created by you will end up in your assignments folder within your Github repository. 
- Attending class is one of the primary keys to doing well in this class. Students may be dropped for excessive absences.
- Make-up exams are not given. If I see fit, then I will replace a missed exam with your final exam test grade (but this is optional to instructor based on circumstances, attendance, participation, etc.).
- Programs containing syntax errors are unacceptable and will be returned without grading (your programs must work).
- Periodically homework assignments will be taken up and graded. It is the student's responsibility to keep up with assignments and to ask questions over the assigned work, even if absent. All homework assignments are due at the specified time that may or may not be in conjunction with a class day. Your assignments / homeworks will be uploaded via Github.
